## Analysis of Sponsored Search Ads RoI
## Introduction
This R Markdown file addresses several key aspects related to RoI calculation and the analysis of sponsored search ads. It aims to highlight the primary issue with the original RoI calculation method, which tends to overestimate revenue by not accounting for organic conversions that are not influenced by sponsored ads.

## First Difference Estimate
To address the issue of overestimation, we implemented a first difference estimate using a linear regression model to analyze the impact of removing sponsored ads on total traffic. This involved creating binary columns for treatment and post-treatment periods, running a linear regression model on Google data, and interpreting the results. The analysis showed a decrease in average total traffic in the absence of sponsored ads.

## Difference-in-Differences (DiD) Analysis
To assess the true impact of sponsored ads on traffic, we employed the Difference-in-Differences (DiD) method. This included checking the parallel assumption between the treatment and control groups and conducting a DiD regression analysis. The results indicated that the absence of sponsored ads led to a significant decrease in total traffic, validating the importance of considering their impact on overall website traffic.

## Refinement in RoI Calculation
Lastly, we suggest a refinement in RoI calculation by excluding clicks from individuals already familiar with the website. This proposed method involves using the difference in difference method to calculate true traffic driven by sponsored ads, leading to a revised RoI calculation that accounts for organic search traffic. By incorporating this adjustment, we aim to provide a more accurate assessment of advertising effectiveness and ultimately optimize marketing strategies.

## Conclusion
Overall, this R Markdown file provides a structured approach to analyzing the impact of sponsored ads on traffic and suggests improvements to RoI calculations for a more accurate assessment of advertising effectiveness.
